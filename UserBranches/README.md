# Getting Started

### How to use the application
To download repositories for a particular user use postman and shoot to - http://localhost:8080/api/v1/repositories/test, where test is a sample username. 
The default header is application/json, so you don't need to specify it. 
However, if you choose the header application/xml then a status of 406 will be returned with the appropriate message


### From me
I unfortunately started writing the app on the day I publish it, because I had a lot of work to do, so I only spent about 3h on it. 
The day I am publishing this app I am flying on holiday, in a few h, so unfortunately I was not able to use the tools I wanted, and refactor the code in such a way that it is of the best quality. 
Greetings :)
